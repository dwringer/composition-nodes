intro: |
  ### Note:

  If you're attempting to use any of the Clipseg nodes and you
  encounter the error, `ValueError: Input image size (352x352) doesn't
  match model (224x224).`, it is because there was a temporary
  regression in the Transformers library that broke Clipseg pipelines
  for a few versions, which got installed with certain
  versions/platforms of InvokeAI. This issue was fixed at least as
  early as Transformers 4.48.3, which can be installed by activating
  your InvokeAI .venv and typing `uv pip install
  transformers==4.48.3`.

  ### Installation:

  To install these nodes, simply place the folder containing this
  repository's code (or just clone the repository yourself) into your
  `invokeai/nodes` folder.

  Generally, the two methods of installation are:

  - Open a terminal with git access (`git bash` on Windows) in
  your InvokeAI home directory, and `cd` to the `nodes`
  subdirectory. If you installed to `C:\Users\<user
  name>\invokeai\` then you will want your terminal to be open to
  `C:\Users\<user name>\invokeai\nodes\`.  Then simply type:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dwringer/composition-nodes.git
  ```

  - Or, download the source code of this repository as a .zip file by
  clicking the green `<> Code` button above and selecting `Download
  ZIP`, then extract the folder within and place it as a subfolder
  inside the `nodes` folder of your InvokeAI home directory (e.g.,
  `C:\Users\<user name>\invokeai\nodes\composition-nodes-master\`)

  ### Nodes since moved to Invoke core:

  The following nodes are no longer maintained here because they were
  integrated with InvokeAI core. If you have a version prior to 5.4.2
  and want to install them anyway, you can revert to the
  pre-invoke-5_4 tag of this repo.

  #### Adjust Image Hue Plus

  Rotate the hue of an image in one of several different color spaces.

  #### Blend Latents/Noise (Masked)

  Use a mask to blend part of one latents/noise tensor into
  another. Can be used to "renoise" sections during a multi-stage
  [masked] denoising process.

  #### Enhance Image

  Boost or reduce color saturation, contrast, brightness, sharpness,
  or invert colors of any image at any stage with this simple wrapper
  for pillow [PIL]'s ImageEnhance module.

  Color inversion is toggled with a simple switch, while each of the
  four enhancer modes are activated by entering a value other than 1
  in each corresponding input field. Values less than 1 will reduce
  the corresponding property, while values greater than 1 will enhance
  it.

  #### Equivalent Achromatic Lightness

  Calculates image lightness accounting for Helmholtz-Kohlrausch
  effect based on a method described by High, Green, and Nussbaum
  (2023) [https://doi.org/10.1002/col.22839].

  #### Image Layer Blend

  Perform a layered blend of two images using alpha
  compositing. Opacity of top layer is selectable, and a mask image
  may also be used. There are currently 23 blend modes supported and 8
  color space modes. Four of the blend modes - Hue, Saturation, Color,
  and Luminosity - are restricted to only 6 of the color space modes:
  RGB and Linear RGB will convert to HSL for those blend
  modes. Several of the other blend modes only operate on the
  lightness channel of non-RGB color space modes.

  Blend modes available: 
    Normal, Lighten Only, Darken Only, Lighten Only (EAL), Darken
    Only (EAL), Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity, Linear Dodge
    (Add), Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Screen, Overlay, Linear
    Burn, Difference, Hard Light, Soft Light, Vivid Light, Linear
    Light, Color Burn, Color Dodge

    Color space modes available:
      RGB, Linear RGB, HSL, HSV, Okhsl, Okhsv, Oklch (Oklab), LCh
      (CIELab)

  #### Image Compositor

  Take a subject from an image with a flat backdrop and layer it on
  another image using a chroma key to specify a color value/threshold
  to remove backdrop pixels, or leave the color blank and a "flood
  select" will be used from the image corners.

  The subject image may be scaled using the fill X and fill Y options
  (enable both to stretch-fit).  Final subject position may also be
  adjusted with X offset and Y offset. If used, chroma key may be
  specified either as an (R, G, B) tuple, or a CSS-3 color string.

  #### Image Dilate or Erode

  Dilate or expand a mask (or any image!). This is equivalent to an
  expand/contract operation.

  #### Image Value Thresholds

  Clip an image to pure black/white beyond specified thresholds.
